## Description

While debating over what I wanted to be my next project, I decided to recreate something I'm sure many of us are very familiar with. This app providing me with a ton of knowledge on TypeScript and Next.js, as well as another opportunity to develop my skills in React further. This is only the start and I'm exciting to continue working with these technologies.
